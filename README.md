# Mastermind
### Ruby & Sinatra

#### Why Sinatra?
This is a project from The Odin Project's curriculum. I'm learning Sinatra to better grasp all the magic happening behind the curtain in Rails. 

#### About the project
I had the choice between recreating my CLI app of Mastermind or Hangman as a web app in Sinatra. I chose Mastermind because its more challenging and I wanted to get some practice doing UI with Bootstrap.

#### Session based
I deployed the app to Heroku when I was done. When I shared the link with a few friends I realized they were all playing the same session. So I went on to learn about sessions in Sinatra and implemented it :-)
